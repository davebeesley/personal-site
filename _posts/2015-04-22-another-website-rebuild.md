So I'm rebuilding my website yet again. After months of mulling over my choices - Perch, Wordpress, Umbraco, building a node based website with an angular front end and a mongodb database. I finally settled on [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com).

At the point I am writing this, I have just built a basic [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) install with the default templates. But over the coming weeks (lunchbreaks), I shall build it out with my own templates and Sass.
