        <h1>David Beesley</h1>
        <p>Hi, thanks for stopping by. As you can see, I have taken the bold step of rebuilding my site in the wild!</p>
        <p>This is just a static holding page for now, and intentionally unstyled to be as accessible as possible, just plain old html</p>
        <p>Over time I will be building this site out using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and blogging about what I have learned along the way, along with my decision making process</p>
        <p>Don't worry, if you stopped by to find out more about me, it is available at <a href="https://legacy.davidbeesley.co.uk/">legacy.davidbeesley.co.uk</a></p>
        <p>In the meantime, I can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:hello@davidbeesley.co.uk">hello@davidbeesley.co.uk<a/> or you can spot me on Twitter at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/davebeesley">twitter.com/davebeesley</a></p>
